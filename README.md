# Your first front-end framework: React

- Repository: `intro-react`
- Mode: `solo`
- Type of Challenge: `learning`
- Duration: `4+1 days`
- Deployment: `Github pages` or `Netlify`

## Learning Objectives

There are many frameworks for many situations. for example Exclusive back-end frameworks like Laravel or Symphony will make the lives of BE-users a lot easier. This is also the case for Frontend frameworks and developers. Today we will dive into one of those amazing frameworks that could make a FE-developer's live easier!!


At the end of this 5-day challenge you will:

- be able to create a new React application
- be able to "think in React"
- be able to use basic hooks for managing state and reactivity
- be able to organize your app in components

## Your mission

This time the task is simple: you will build a small Todo application that lives in your browser, and saves todos even after restarting the browser.

## ðŸŒ± Must-have's

- Read this documentation on [The Basics](0.The-Basics/README.md)
- Create a React application and run it locally on your browser (hint-hint: [start here](1.Getting-Started/README.md))
- Publish the source code on your GitHub repository
- Build a Todo App with React.js (Check out this useful [instructions](2.Extra-Documentation) )
- Save your todo's, even after starting the browser again
- Deploy the project on a live server 
  _Tip if you choose Netlify: to deploy a React app you first run the command `npm run build`, and once the command finishes you will have your app ready in the `build` folder: just drag and drop this folder in Netlify and you are done. Easy!_

## ðŸŒ¼ Nice-to-have (doable)
- Refactor parts you aren't happy with.
- Rebuild from scratch without any tutorial to improve your understanding ([Instructions](2.Extra-Documentation) will be of a big help here!).
- Improve on your project so that it's not only a learning repository, but also a show off project when interviewing:
  - Add styling
  - Improve responsiveness
  - Check for little, smooth effects
  - Think UX: what extra features can make your todo app better?


## ðŸŒ³ Nice-to-have (hard)

Done all of the above? Don't worry! We have some more you can do:

- Install a react package of a calendar and implement it in a new component into your App.
- Install and use React-router-dom as a router between components. _(Hint: Think about a structure like: router -> show component)_

- See if someone else needs help.
- Have a live edit option for existing todo's (when you click on the text of a todo, the app allows you to edit it in place).
- Make a version with another JS framework like VueJS or Svelte.

## Good luck!
